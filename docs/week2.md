# Week 2 -

This week, we covered foundational topics involving design processes and began applying them to our website redesign project. These processes and principles apply to design in general, not only web development.

## Topics Covered

### User-Centered Design

This is a process to design products that fulfill its purpose and maximize user satisfaction.

#### Steps of User-Centered Design

1. _Understand the context_ in which the product is used
2. _Specify the requirements_ of a successful design
3. _Design solutions_ that meet the requirements
4. _Evaluate_ the solutions

### Design Thinking

Similarly to user-centered design, this is a design process to create solutions to problems people face. The main difference between the two processes are that design thinking emphasizes creating solutions, while user-centered design ensures those solutions are easy to use.

#### Steps of Design Thinking

1. **Empathize:** identify a problem
2. **Define:** articulate the problem and its causes
3. **Ideate:** brainstorm any potential solutions that come to mind
4. **Prototype:** pick the best solutions to begin designing
5. **Test:** ensure these prototypes fulfill their purpose

### 7 Usability Factors

A product must have these characteristics to ensure user satisfaction. I will illustrate this by giving the example of how an aluminium water bottle demonstrates these factors.

1. **Useful:** it solves the problem of its users needing to repeatedly get up to get water.
2. **Useable:** it is very intuitive in its function and easy to use.
3. **Findable:** they can be found in most chain stores.
4. **Credible:** its professionally-made appearance gives users an impression that they can use it without having issues.
5. **Desirable:** its design entices users to choose it over a plastic water bottle.
6. **Accessible:** its intuitive design makes it useable for users with vision impairments.
7. **Valuable:** it is the most effective solution to a problem everybody faces.

These factors provide me with a criteria to evaluate my solutions in my website redesign by how effectively it allows users to achieve their goals.

## Activities and Assignments

### Websites That Follow and Do Not Follow Usability Factors

To recognize the importance of each of the 7 usability factors, each group found one website that follows the a specific usability factor and one that does not. My group was assigned to find a website that is **useable** and one that is **not valuable**.

Our choice for a website that is usable was [the BCIT website](https://www.bcit.ca/).

This website is useable as its information structure is very intuitive with very easy-to-read text. Users can navigate the website without many issues.

Our choice for a website that is not valuable is [MapQuest](https://www.mapquest.com/).

This website is no longer valuable as Google Maps fulfills its purpose while being ad-free and implementing more useful features.

### Redesign Proposal

This assignment involved us analyzing the business and the issues with the site to effectively brainstorm solutions that benefit the business.

After our analysis, we outlined **3 main issues** with the website.

- Poorly formatted navigation bar and information structure make the site difficult to navigate
- Unappealing formatting of the shop with a difficult to find cart page
- Inconsistent CSS styling with a theme that does not cater to the audience, giving the website an unprofessional impression

We aim to resolve these issues by

- Polishing CSS styling
- Adding a tasteful amount of animations for a more professional look
- Adjusting the navigation bar to be easier to use
- Reordering information structure
- Adjusting branding colours to appeal to intended audiences

### Market Research

To better our understanding of what an effective website in this business would look like, we analyzed two other cupcake shop websites in the Toronto area.

#### [Cupcake Paradise](https://www.cupcakeparadise.ca/)

This website succeeds at

- Making a professional impression with high-quality photos and well-structured interactive elements
- Utilizing a trendy design

This website could improve on

- Conveying a more apparent connection to community
- Branding that appeals to corporations (to compete with Toronto Cupcakes)

#### [The Cupcake Shoppe](https://thecupcakeshoppe.ca/)

This website succeeds at

- Creating a sense of credibility through well-structured UI
- Implementing an intuitive and functional cart feature

This website could improve on

- Communicating information on the business itself and its place in the community
- Using higher-quality images
