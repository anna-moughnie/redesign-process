# Week 2

This week, we covered User Personas, User Stories, and User Scenarios, and made each of the three for our term project.

## User Personas

These involve imagining a potential user of our website and characteristics such as their age, goals, things that they struggle with that our product can resolve (pain points), among many other factors that can give us a better understanding of our audience as developers.

### Persona 1: **Cheryl Cunningham**

This user represents the Toronto Cupcakes' corporate audience. She is an assistant executive director for Toronto RBC Banking. She wants to organize enjoyable work events to boost productivity and morale. She struggles with time and keeping track of all the allergens in the food she orders for events.

### Persona 2: **Ava Davis**

This user represents the audience of customers who need desserts for more casual events. She is an elementary school teacher and needs fun desserts for her wedding. She struggles with time and keeping track of allergens for her guests, as planning a wedding is very time-consuming.

### Takeaway From User Personas

Both types of users need an efficient transaction with easy-to-find information on allergens.

## User Stories

To improve our understanding of the features our website needs to meet the needs of our audience, we created *3 user stories* for each of our user personas. User stories are statements that use the following format:

*As a [type of person], I want to [complete an action] so that I can [achieve a goal]*

For the sake of conciseness, I will only give one example for each persona.

### Cheryl Cunningham

*As an assistant ED, I want to quickly see what cupcakes are available and order them so
that I can carry on with the rest of my work tasks.*

### Ava Davis

*As a wedding planner, I want to easily learn about allergens of different cupcakes, so that I
can order cupcakes suitable for all my guests and me.*

### Takeaway From User Stories

Our website should be easy to navigate with an intuitive information structure for users to find information and make transactions in a timely manner.

## User Scenarios

For developers to begin designing UI, it's important to **put ourselves in the shoes of our users** through user scenarios: statements that examine the steps necessary to complete a user story.

### User Scenario 1

*As a wedding planner, I want to easily learn about allergens of different cupcakes, so that I
can order cupcakes suitable for all my guests and me.*

#### Steps

1. Start at home page
2. Navigate to cupcake catalogue
3. Filter listings by allergen
4. navigate to allergen page for more information (allergens found in kitchen)

### User Scenario 2

*As a wedding planner, I want to easily order cupcakes in bulk, so that I can have an easier
time organizing my wedding*

#### Steps

1. start at home page
2. navigate to order page for information on minimum order size, bulk order specifics, company invoicing, etc.
3. call bakery to place bulk orders

### Takeaway From User Scenarios

For the website to be effective at satisfying its users, it must have easy-to-find information on cupcakes and how to order them.
