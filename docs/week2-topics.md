# Week 2A - Design Processes and Fundamentals

To create products that people will want to use, designers need to follow specific design processes that produce the most effective solution to a problem. This week, we covered foundational topics regarding general design processes and applied them to web design.

## User-Centered Design

This is a process to design products that fulfill its purpose and maximize user satisfaction.

### Steps of User-Centered Design

1. _Understand the context_ in which the product is used
2. _Specify the requirements_ of a successful design
3. _Design solutions_ that meet the requirements
4. _Evaluate_ the solutions

As this process is specific to creating new products rather than redesigning existing ones, we will not be using this process for our term project. I will use this process often throughout my career as a web developer when designing new websites from scratch.

## Design Thinking

Similarly to user-centered design, this is a design process to create solutions to problems people face. The main difference between the two processes is that design thinking emphasizes creating solutions, while user-centered design ensures those solutions are easy to use.

### Steps of Design Thinking

1. **Empathize:** identify a problem
2. **Define:** articulate the problem and its causes
3. **Ideate:** brainstorm any potential solutions that come to mind
4. **Prototype:** pick the best solutions to begin designing
5. **Test:** ensure these prototypes fulfill their purpose

I will be using this process to identify issues with the original [Toronto Cupcake website](https://www.torontocupcake.com/index.html) and design solutions to address them.

## 7 Usability Factors

A product must have these characteristics to ensure user satisfaction. I will illustrate this by giving the example of how an aluminum water bottle demonstrates these factors.

1. **Useful:** it solves the problem of its users needing to repeatedly get up to get water.
2. **Useable:** it is very intuitive in its function and easy to use.
3. **Findable:** they can be found in most chain stores.
4. **Credible:** its professionally-made appearance gives users an impression that they can use it without having issues.
5. **Desirable:** its design entices users to choose it over a plastic water bottle.
6. **Accessible:** its intuitive design makes it useable for users with vision impairments.
7. **Valuable:** it is the most effective solution to a problem everybody faces.

These factors provide me with a criteria to evaluate my solutions in my website redesign by how effectively it allows users to achieve their goals.

We began applying these concepts through the activities covered in the [next page](./week2-activities.md).
