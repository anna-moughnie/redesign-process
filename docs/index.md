# Redesign Process

This document details weekly updates regarding my process of redesigning a website for my User Experience/User Interface (UX/UI) Design class. The aim of my writing is to demonstrate my UI design process and approach to managing large tasks.

## Why I'm Working in a Team

I chose to work with a team because I tend to work faster when I work with others. This is because I tend to complete my contributions earlier, as to be considerate of my teammates' time. Brainstorming phases are also much faster in groups as more ideas are contributed and also verbalized, better establishing them and making them easier to analyze.

## What I Hope to Get From UX/UI Design Class

I hope to become familiar enough with the processes of designing UI to comfortably apply them to my future projects. I would like to learn how to minimize and better spot mistakes in my web projects.

## What I Hope to Get From Business Communications Class

As this document is my term project for my Communications class, I aim to develop more effective communication skills by regularly practicing the 7 C's of communication throughout the process of writing.

For both classes, I hope to improve my ability to work in a team.

## Intended Audience

This document was written for my Communications instructor and for potential employers to learn about my work process.

## Intended Tone

I hope to achieve a conversational tone with clear passion for the project.
