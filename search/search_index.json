The poor website structure and design, dated branding, and unintuitive navigation make it difficult to use the website, which may incline customers to opt for a different bakery with a more professional-looking website. The website should be redesigned as soon as possible to start effectively appealing to its intended audiences. The focus on the redesign should be for its corporate customers, because their corporate-specific catering is a niche that could help the business stand out among competitors.</p> <p>From this statement, we gained a clearer understanding of the exact issues of the site, providing a smoother transition into the ideation phases of the redesign.</p>"},{"location":"4-ux-ui-ideation/#feature-list","title":"Feature List","text":"<p>With the site's issues summarized in the problem statement, we began analyzing the page for specific changes to be made in the redesign.
